This is my personal portofolio website
I plan doing this using only the most basic tools. 
For design:
1. Wire frame using Fireframe.cc
2. Mockup using Figma

For implementation:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript

User stories:

1. The site should have an intro displaying when first loading the page. I should be a cool shor animation, introducing myself.

2. At the top of the page there should be a hero banner with my phote, a site menu and an inspirational quotation.
    --Site menu: Bio, Projects

3. There should be a bio section where I should present a few key facts about myself, a short bio. 
    -There should be a download CV button.
    -There should be some bio-cards wit some animation.

4. There should be a projects section where I showcase a few of my top projects so far.
Projects should be presentes in a carousel of iFrames. Each iFrame should link to a separate page with detailed description for the each project. 

5. There should be a contact section, with the logos of the technologies I am competent on, also a contact form.
There should be email address and telephone number displayed.  There should be also a copyright footer, right at the bottom.

6. There should be a mobile-firendly version as well
